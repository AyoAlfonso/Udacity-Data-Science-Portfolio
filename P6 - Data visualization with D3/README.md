This project work visualizes Titanic survival based on passenger information such as gender and cabin class.Various visual encodings have been utilized such as color, stacked bar, also it incorporates both author-driven narratives and reader-driven exploration through use of button press & tooltip to make the plots more interactive.

#Summary:
This bar chart stacks the percentage and absolute number of passengers survived or dead during the tragic sink. It can be seen that gender is the dominant driver for suvival. Women have much higher chance than men to survive in every cabin class. In terms of cabin calss, generally speaking, passengers in first class have much higher chance to survive than those in second & third class.

#Feedback

Feedbacks have been collected and used to improve the plots:

1.Table titles, lables have been modifited to in be more intuitive.
2.Interactive buttons are added to show both count and proportion of the data.
3.Reformatted the overall page to tie three plots with explanatory narratives and center all the information in the middle.

###Feedback on original plots:

**Areas which are working well:**

1.The findings are very clear that each plot focuses on a clear, specific finding.
2.The color choice is really nice in all three plots. Desaturated colors for the deceased is very effective, and you chose unconventional (but clear) color for gender

**Things to improve:**

1.It'd be nice (if possible) to see a toggle that allows the plot to show proportions instead of just raw counts.
2.The axis labels could be changed to be more readable. Right now they are at the ends of each axis, and one is inside the plot, while the other is outside.It would be nice if they were in more conventional locations (e.g., outside the plot in the center of each axis.
3.It would be better for the actual title (e.g. "Cabin class impact on survival chance") with the plot.
4.Since there are three visualizations, make sure to tie them together with a single story/focus.


###Feedback on the final version:

1.What do you notice in the visualization?
-The presentation was excellent. Especially the chart 'Titanic Survival vs Cabin Class/Gender' (I've looked at many graphs of this dataset and few highlight the information contained in that chart in such a stark way)
-The inclusion of count and percentage was a clever touch.
Obviously, what I noticed in the visualisation was the gender and class based distinctions.

2.What relationships do you notice?
-The relationship that I noticed in the visualisation was the gender and class based distinctions.

3.What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
-I especially like the progression: Class, Gender, Class & Gender, of the visualization

4.Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
-No, it is clearly presented.
